                <h1>The Situation</h1>
                <p>Due to climate change, multiple landslides, lightning strikes, and flash floods across India and
                    Bangladesh millions have been displaced and hundreds have died. </p>
                <p>Northeastern India and Northern Bangladesh are experiencing some of the worst floods in the
                    region in years, leaving some towns completely cut off and underwater.</p>
                <h2>The flash floods in Northern Bangladesh affected an estimated 4.3 million people in seven
                    northeastern districts.</h2>
                <p>Around 94% of Sunamganj and over 84% of Sylhet are underwater.</p>
                <p>The situation is worsening as rainfall continues. With major roads, railways and air services
                    suspended, accessing these communities will become more difficult as the situation progresses.
